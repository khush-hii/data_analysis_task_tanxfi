Customer Orders Analysis
Problem Statement
You have been given a dataset of customer orders from an online store. The data is in a CSV file orders.csv with the following columns:

order_id: unique identifier for each order
customer_id: unique identifier for each customer
order_date: date when the order was placed
product_id: unique identifier for each product
product_name: name of the product
product_price: price of the product
quantity: quantity of the product ordered
Your task is to write a Python program that reads the data from the CSV file and performs the following tasks:

Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset.
Compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.
Compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset.
Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

Architecture
The project is divided into two main services:

Main Application Service: Reads the data from the CSV file and performs the required tasks.
Test Service: Runs the test cases to ensure the correctness of the application.
Main Application Service
main.py: Entry point of the application. Reads the CSV file and calls functions from revenue_calculator.py to compute the required statistics.
revenue_calculator.py: Contains functions to compute total revenue by month, product, and customer, and to identify the top 10 customers by revenue.
Test Service
test_main.py: Contains test cases to validate the functionality of the main application.
Instructions to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Docker
Docker Compose
Steps to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-orders-analysis.git
cd customer-orders-analysis
Build and start the services using Docker Compose:

sh
docker-compose up --build
Main Application Service:

The main application service will start and read the data from orders.csv, performing the required calculations. The results will be displayed in the console.

Test Service:

The test service will automatically run the test cases defined in tests/test_main.py. The results of the tests will be displayed in the console.

Stopping the Services
To stop the services, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where Docker Compose is running.

Additional Commands
To rebuild the services without starting them:

sh
docker-compose build
To start the services without rebuilding:

sh
docker-compose up
To run the tests manually:

sh
docker-compose run test
Detailed Steps
Build the Docker Images
Main Application Service:

The Dockerfile for the main application service is as follows:

Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app
requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY src/ src/
COPY orders.csv .

CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]
Test Service:

The Dockerfile.test for the test service is as follows:

Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY tests/ tests/
COPY src/ src/
COPY orders.csv .

CMD ["pytest", "tests"]
Docker Compose Configuration
The docker-compose.yml file to set up both services:

yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: customer_orders_app
    depends_on:
      - db

  test:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.test
    container_name: customer_orders_test
    depends_on:
      - db
Additional Notes
Make sure the orders.csv file is in the root directory of the project.
Update the requirements.txt file with necessary Python dependencies.

Steps to Execute the Task
Ensure Required Software is Installed:

Confirm that Python is installed on your system.
Ensure the Pandas library is installed.
Prepare the Dataset:

Save your data in a CSV file named orders.csv.
Create the Python Script:

Open a text editor or IDE.
Create a new Python file (e.g., orders.py).
we can do it in google collab or jupyter notebook in anaconda.
Copy the provided code into this file.
Understand the Code:

The script loads the dataset from the CSV file.
It converts the order_date column to a datetime format.
It calculates the revenue for each order by multiplying the product_price by the quantity.
The script groups data by month to compute total monthly revenue.
It groups data by product to compute total revenue for each product.
It groups data by customer to compute total revenue for each customer.
It identifies and prints the top 10 customers by revenue generated.
Run the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script file.
Execute the script to see the results printed in the terminal.
Review the Output:

The script will display total revenue by month.
It will show total revenue for each product.
It will list total revenue generated by each customer.
Finally, it will identify the top 10 customers by the revenue they generated.
